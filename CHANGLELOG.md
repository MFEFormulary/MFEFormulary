## MFE Formulary Change Log

The following lists contain the changes (additions, corrections,
typos, notes) that have been made to each revision of the MFE
Formulary. The intention is to provide alert users to errors in
previous revisions that may have/may be affecting their research and
to provide transparency on the development of the Formulary

#### Revision : February 2014

* New title page reflecting Yuri's new institution, url linked CC
by-SA logo

* New "Information" chapter to contain various important items:
acknowledgements, disclaiminer, license, contributions, etc

* Added "Preface", "Information", "References", and "Index" chapters
to the table of contents and to the hyperlinked menu at left in PDFs
for easy access to entire document.

* Replaced all collision operators "df/dt_c" with "C(f)" to standardize
to much more widely used notation outside of kinetic theory (multiple
chapters)

* Changed all thermal electron/ion velocities from v_{The}/v_{Thi} to
v_{te}/v_{ti} to standardize with NRL formulary, other textbooks, and
shorten variable names (multiple chapters)

* Changed particle subscripts "x" and "y" to "a" (approaching) and "t"
(target) to avoid confusion with (x,y) as directions (Ch4, p39)

* Added definition of the Coulomb Logarithm (Ch4, p39)

* Corrected "n" to "n_{i}" in ion-ion collsion time formulary (Ch4, p40)

* Modified equations for thermal speed to sqrt(T/m) to reflect that
they are the std dev of a Gaussian distribution. Added footnote
discussion the alternative definition and motivation. (Ch5, p43)

* Fixed sqrt(2) discrepancy in Debye length equations. Defined lambda_e
as electron-present only shielding and removed sqrt(2) from
exponential in ion shielding equation (Ch5, p44)

* Changed lower limits from "0" to "-infinity" on the y and z integrals
for the thermal particle flux definition (Ch5, p46)

* Moved the Table of equations in Section 6.3 to normal "fla" equations
for better typesetting (Ch6, p53)

* Corrected definition of nu_star (Ch7, p64)

* Changed "<<" to ">>" to fix Pfirsh-Schluter collisionality inequality
(Ch7, p64)

* Added factor of "1 / 1 + delta_1,2" to reaction rate equations that
is required for like,unlike particle species (See Eq 10, Hale-Bosch NF
32 (1992) 611). Reference changed accordingly. (Ch9, p77)

* Replaced cross section and volumetric reaction rate figures with new
ones generated by IPython notebook calculations. They are based on the
B-H cross section and reaction rate parameterization, and
simultaneously correct several errors that existed in the previous
version graphs of these quantities (Ch9, p81)

* Added NSTX-U to the tokamaks section (Ch13, p107)

* Corrected spelling of 'Fokker-Planck' in the index (Index, p113)
